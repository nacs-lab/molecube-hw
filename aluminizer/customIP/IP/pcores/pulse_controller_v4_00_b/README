This directory contains files to define a pulse_controller peripheral on a Zynq (or other) FPGA.
Author: Till Rosenband

The pulse_controller has 3 main features:
1. Generate precisely timed digital output patterns
2. Program external DDS (AD9914) as part of the precise timing sequence
3. Count input pulses (from a PMT or other).
4. Record timing distribution of PMT pulses with respect to a sync pulse.
   This feature is used for correlated photon counting.
   
The design is used by the Xilinx Embedded Development Kit or PlanAhead as part of a repository.

The peripheral communicates with a CPU accross an AXI bus.
This design is written in the verilog language.

Directories and files:

hdl/verilog                         -- verilog design files
hdl/vhdl                            -- VHDL stub / wrapper
hdl/ise/*.xise                      -- Xilinx ISE project files 
hdl/ise/*.wcfg                      -- Xilinx simulator files 
data/pulse_controller_v2_1_0.mpd    -- Define ports and paramaters for connection to the rest of the FPGA and externally.
data/pulse_controller_v2_1_0.pao    -- List all source file to build synthesize the peripheral
data/_pulse_controller_xst.prj      -- Some kind of project files.  Probably unused and obsolete.

If ports are to be added to the design, they must be defined in the .mpd file, the VHDL wrapper, and the verilog file.
They also need to be added to the global design (MHS and UCF files when using Xilinx PlanAhead/EDK/XPS software)
